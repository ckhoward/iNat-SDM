    "## Getting started:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clone the required projects\n",
    " * Get Jeff Oliver's SDM with ```clone https://github.com/jcoliver/ebutterfly-sdm.git```\n",
    " * Get this program with ```clone https://github.com/ckhoward/ebutterfly-sdm.git```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Get your data\n",
    " * If downloading [GBIF Observations](http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/gbif-observations-dwca.zip), unzip the downloaded file, and move observations.csv into the directory ebutterfly-sdm/data/ (warning: many input files will be generated here)\n",
    " * If using updater.py and observation_getter.py..\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Organize your files\n",
    " * Place inat_request.ipynb into the directory ebutterfly-sdm/ (this notebook will act as command and control)\n",
    " * Place organize.py into the directory ebutterfly-sdm/data/\n",
    " * Move taxon_list.txt from ebutterfly-sdm/data/gbif/ to ebutterfly-sdm/data/inaturalist"

    "## How to use:\n",
    "Run organize.py with ```python organize.py``` from the command line. This script:\n",
    " * Cleans the observations.csv data by removing extraneous and/or missing data (IDs not listed in Jeff's taxon_list file, for instance);\n",
    " * Creates a user-friendly file, data_for_sdm.csv, containing all observations, with data for taxonId, year, month, latitude, and longitude. A text copy is created too, just in case it is preferred. This makes it easier for users to sift through the data of interest, to find any glaring issues;\n",
    " * Creates 13 text files for every species listed in data_for_sdm.csv, one for each month, and one for all months, to be used as input for the SDM, as the format [taxonid-month-iNaturalist].\n",

    "Notice that the IDs are hardcoded. We know this is not ideal and are working on a fix. In the meantime, we have created a massive list of space separated IDs that can be plugged in as necessary. The list can be found [here](https://pastebin.com/sYdqyXqL). Additionally, organize.py contains a commented out function that takes taxon_list.txt and provides an output that can be copied and pasted into the bash ID array contained in the notebook. Thus, you're given the flexibility to choose what specific IDs you want to observe."

    "## Warnings\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data integrity:\n",
    "\n",
    "From iNaturlist:\n",
    "> \"Our export system is a bit flawed, though: if you alter the filters to get more than 10,000 records\n",
    "it may start omitting data, so the above techniques would probably be better. Plus, if you use GBIF,\n",
    "your [users] can benefit from even more records from museums and such.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyone using iNaturalist data should perhaps use our API access code, Jeff's, or download the DwC-A that iNaturalist makes for GBIF.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the research-grade observations did not have latitude and longitude entries. Our script takes care of this by omitting these data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Runtimes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Approximate run time for organization.py to clean and organize/write needed files for the SDM : ~5minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "Approximate run time for SDM/R Script to fully run 5 Taxon ID's and recieve Raster Images: ~3minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "Estimated run time for SDM/R Script to fully run all 760-780 Taxon ID's and recieve Raster Images: ~6.5hours\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Space requirement:\n",
    "\n",
    "When running the SDM on 760 species, the output produced is approximately 16 GBs in total. Consider your hard drive space before utilizing the SDM on large numbers of species.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Map Errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "After running the SDM, you will likely notice maps produced with yellow bands, or kernel output noting issues with the mins, maxes, and correlations. This is due to the input having either no data, or too few observations. If the input has more than 12 observations, the generated outputs will be correct."
